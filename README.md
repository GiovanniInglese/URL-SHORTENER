This is a short and simple URL shortener using an API that shortens your url link and changes it to something shorter that youn would prefer.  This program utilizes the python language as well as the python tool library.  I used the requests module to allow the program to directly connect to the api using the API key and allow the website to chorten my link to a name of my choosing.  The program is functional and also utilizes using an API to extract and produce information.  We defined a function for shortning a given link and used requests to request the api website to shorten the link using the API key for paramenters as well as the link and the name you wnat to change it to.  The API then attempts to produce the sorten api linka nd if if cant then it will print the proper code for the error that occured.
